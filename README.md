I enjoy working on GitHub
This is an amazing workspace for all developers ranging from; beginners to professionals
Giihub is a working and collaborative space for developers to work remotely
Git on the other hand is a tool that enable developers to develope and create code and push it into the centralised repository
There are some basic commands and key terms to be mastered while using GitHub as a service and git in general. these include; git pull, git push, git commit, git fetch, git clone, and git merge.
Git pull downloads recent changes from our remote repository into our local computer automatically merging them
Git Push uploads recent changes from our local computer into our centralised repository and automatically merging them. we use the command, git push -u origin main (in other to uploead to our main branch. but in case we have multiple branches, we need to precise the exact branch in which we want to push it to.)
Git Commit helps us to commit changes we make both on our local machine and on our remote repository. commit in other words is giving it a tagging message which we want to see appear.
Git fetch downloads our recent changes from our remote repository into our local machine without necessarily merging them. it gives us the option to view and accept it first before we can do the merging ourselves.
Git clone, helps us to duplicate a repository automatically. this must be a repository which exists already.
git merge helps us to join information existing together.
